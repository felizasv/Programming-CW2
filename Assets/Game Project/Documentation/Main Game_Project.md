# Main Game Project

In this project I decided to show the packages I've created through the small love story. 

1. It's possible to see the Player Controller component on the Player
2. The Camera Movement Component on the Camera
3. The Parallax Background movement on the background sprites and 
4. The Loading Screen Component on the Canvas of the Main Scene. 

I imported all the packages in the Project and used the scripts and sprites from them.
